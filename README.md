TypeScriptMastery
=================

A project for investigating the use of TypeScript with AngularJs and RequireJs.

The master branch uses RequireJs with one class per file and no grouping of classes in TypeScript modules.

The UsingReferences branch implements [basarat](https://github.com/basarat/video-angular-typescript)'s approach which uses grunt to compile all .ts files into one app-code file.
